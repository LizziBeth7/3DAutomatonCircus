<h1> Automaton Circus </h1>
<p>The Automaton Circus is a 50 second animation of animal style robots performing circus acts. The animals and circus apparatuses were modeled, textured and animated using Maya. </p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>My Animation is a Circus made up of robotic animals. So I used Bing AI image generation (as recommended by tutor) to make some robot animals to use as reference. Then I also have some tent lighting that I thought would be cool to incorporate. </p>

<h3>Storyboard</h3>
<p>The original scene plan had 5 tents set up in a semi-circle with the largest set in the middle. The animation starts with the camera panning into the tent on the left, where some robot bears are dancing. It then goes to the next tent with a juggling Unicorn. Then the robot elephant runs across the scene and the camera follows it to the tent on the right where the elephant balances on a ball. Then onto the next tent where the Ram robots have made a pyramid. Finally onto the last tent where the robot tiger is doing aerial swings using its tail to jump. </p>

<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>The animal models were then built in Maya along with the trapeeze, elephant ball and juggling balls. The tent model was downloaded from sketchfab but I haven't been able to relocate the link in order to reference it.</p>

<h3>Final Animation</h3>
<p>Although the storyboard had each animal in their own tent, the final animation has them performing all together in one large tent so that I could focus on the lighting within the tent and not the background outside it. I could not do the outside scene as I wanted within the time constraints. The Unicorn also changed to juggling knives which I had modeled for a previous project.The sky background was sourced from sketchfab at <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/fantasy-sky-background-15c79bb2fc1147128039fe4ff90fd5a0#download">this link</a> The floor pattern was a free download from <a href="https://mosaictileoutlet.com/products/mtot0006-modern-hexagon-gold-metallic-handcut-glass-mosaic-tile">mosaic tile outlet</a>(website no longer active) The music is royalty free from unknown source.</p>
